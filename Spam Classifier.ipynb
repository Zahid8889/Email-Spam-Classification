      " The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a\n",

      " help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to\n",
      " express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the\n",
      " murder of \"Babs\" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he\n",
      " has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was\n",
      " published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an\n",
      " award-winning film. \n",
      " \n",
      " Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in\n",
      " Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison\n",
      " officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being\n",
      " transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and\n",
      " developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,\n",
      " a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received\n",
      " critical praise. \n",
      " \n",
      " And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books\n",

      " deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt\n",
      " scribbling away as we speak. \n",
      " \n",
      " So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so\n",
      " destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck\n",
      " on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books\n",
      " about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both\n",

      " He says: \"Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have\n",

      " \n",
      " However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:\n",
      " \"Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine\n",
      " the very essence of who they are. \n",
      " \n",
      " \"They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or\n",
      " am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something\n",
      " good?\" \n",
      " \n",
      " Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that\n",
      " of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered\n",
      " mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed\n",
      " robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term\n",
      " over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was\n",

      " two days during a jail siege. \n",
      " \n",
      " Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is\n",
